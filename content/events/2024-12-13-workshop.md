## About

Join us for another workshop about live coding, co-organized with Baltan Laboratories (located in the historical Natlab building) in Eindhoven. 

Join media artist Niki Scheijen and discover Hydra: a browser-based tool for creating real-time visuals through code. In this hands-on workshop you’ll get comfortable with coding live graphics, from basic patterns to audio-reactive visuals. Perfect for both complete beginners and the code-curious, no experience is needed. By the end, you'll have the skills to create your own visual experiments at home. Just bring your laptop and curiosity.

## Niki Scheijen (Nikilia)

[Niki Scheijen](https://nikischeijen.nl/). Intrigued by the endless possibilities of live coding Niki likes to take an experimental approach to create unique visual experiences. She loves to explore the different forms of media and technology (ranging from digital to analog, or a combination of both!) to find new ways of expression.

## About Hydra
Hydra is live code-able video synth and coding environment that runs directly in the browser. It is free and open-source and made for beginners and experts alike.

### Hydra can be used:

- to mix and add effects to camera feeds, screenshares, live streams, and videos
- to create generative and audio-reactive visuals, and share them online with others
- in combination with other javascript libraries such as P5.js, Tone.js, THREE.js, or gibber
- to add interactive video effects to a website
- to experiment with and learn about video feedback, fractals, and pixel operations
- to stream video between browsers and live-jam with others online
