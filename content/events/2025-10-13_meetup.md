## About

Join us for an open meetup of the live coding community in Rotterdam (the RLCC, Rotterdam Live Coders Community). Participating artists will show their work environments and creative ideas. The event is an informal yet informative open session and anyone from the public is very welcome to participate, you do not need to have previous experience in live coding or software development. The idea is to share, learn and get inspired in dialogue.

The collective is a dynamic group that welcomes anyone with curiosity and a will to participate. We will be showing our live coded works on a big screen and speakers, open a dialogue and we hope to see your works as well. And, as is common in live coding meetups, we like to have a “from-scratch” jam session at the end.
