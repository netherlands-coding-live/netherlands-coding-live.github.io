## About

Join us for a live coding meetup in the office space of Creative Coding Utrecht in the Boomtoren at 't Hof van Cartesius. 

We’re starting the evening off with a talk about live coding, followed by a showcase to put it all in action. Later in the evening you can also join the Jam to show us what you’ve been working on yourself. If you’re interested in that, please email us at info@creativecodingutrecht.nl so we can put your name on the setlist. Don’t forget to mention if you wish to code visuals or audio. If you’d rather join to sit back and enjoy the show, you’re just as welcome!
