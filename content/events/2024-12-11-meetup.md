## About

Join us for a last-minute informal live coding meetup in the new blackbox space of GROND in Amsterdam, hosted by Marije Baalman. We’re starting the evening with some presentations about live coding projects that our community is currently working on. Later in the evening there is also space to have a from-scratch live coding jam. We're asking a small sliding scale entrance fee to pay for the usage of the space. If you are curious about code, or just want to enjoy music, visuals and more, come and join!

Organised together with [Marije Baalman](https://marijebaalman.eu/) and [GROND](https://grond.community/)
