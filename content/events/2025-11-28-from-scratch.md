## About

Before the Algorave starts, but after the Iterations Conference ends, we'll have a brief from-scratch session in one of the spaces in the Grey Space. Live coders from NL_CL (and international guests at the Symposium) will take the stage for a 9-minute from-scratch improvisation with audio and/or visuals.

The from-scratch rules:
- Live code for 9 minutes (no more, no less, we set a timer)
- Use the language of your choosing
- Start with an empty code editor/screen
- Program music or visuals (or something else if you have crazy ideas!)
- The audience always claps at the end!
- The line-up is decided (psuedo-)randomly at the beginning of the event

⚠️ NOTE: We care about equity and accessibility. For this reason, these prices are adjustable. Please contact us if you feel held back by these prices.

🌑 In partnership with The Grey Space in the Middle, Rewire, Institute of Sonology
