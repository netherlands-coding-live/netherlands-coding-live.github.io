## About

Open livecoding meetup for everyone interested in livecoding. Instead of our usual monthly Rotterdam meetup, this month we'll be heading over to The Hague to celebrate the 15 year anniversary of the from scratch livecoding format. Join a 9 minute coding session or just enjoy watching other people livecode from scratch! All skill levels are welcome to try, no signup needed, just show up. You can find more info about from scratch [here](https://zenodo.org/records/3939206). For this edition [studio RNDR](https://rndr.studio/) is kindly sharing their studio space with us. 

- 💻 Bring your laptop
- 🧃 There will be some drinks on donation basis

The from-scratch rules:
- Live code for 9 minutes (no more, no less, we set a timer)
- Use the language of your choosing
- Start with an empty code editor/screen
- Program music or visuals (or something else if you have crazy ideas!)
- The audience always claps at the end!
- The line-up is decided (psuedo-)randomly at the beginning of the event

## Livestream

The event is streamed live to [Eulerroom](https://eulerroom.com/)
