## About

Join us in November for an engaging live coding workshop that combines programming with artistic expression. Guided by digital-craft artist Flor de Fuego, this workshop explores how code can be used to craft interactive performative experiences. Flor's work emphasises the connections between space, the body, and the flow of chaos and order, drawing from her experience with Hydra and her involvement in international live coding communities.

This workshop offers a calm space to learn about the artistic potential of live coding; an inspiring opportunity for anyone curious about the creative side of code!
