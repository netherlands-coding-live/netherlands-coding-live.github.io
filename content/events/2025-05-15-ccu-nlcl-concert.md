## About

Join us for an evening of live coded music made by artists from the Netherlands Coding Live community (NL_CL). This event is organised as a satellite event around the International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC), which is happening in Barcelona in the end of May this year. During the concert the performers explore the theme of "Liveness". It has been 10 years since the first ICLC happened. Over the years many interfaces and algorithms have been invented to explore and interact with sound and visuals. Expect an evening full of algorithmic thinking, live programming, showing screens, fixing errors and adventurous music and visuals.
