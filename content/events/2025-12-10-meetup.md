## About  
Keep up with the Live Coding Meet-ups — monthly gatherings for anyone curious about creative coding, generative visuals, algorithmic sound, and collaborative digital art. Our local live coding community is growing with new coders, beginners and veterans, visual and sound artists, engineers and simply curious participants. Join our coming gathering and share your screen with us!

🗓️ Wednesday, Dec 10 | 6:00 – 9:00 PM

📍 BlaBlaLab, Eindhoven

🎟️ Reserve your spot via Eventbrite

💸 Open donation — pay what you can to support the initiative

These meet-ups offer a wider space for sharing work-in-progress, new tools and ideas, exchanging feedback, and fostering a vibrant local community of coders, live coders, enthusiasts and beginners. Whether you're developing new performances, experimenting with live visuals, crafting algorithms, or just starting out with coding, these evenings are designed to help you progress your practice in a supportive and dynamic environment.

Each session also dedicates time to collectively brainstorm and develop a community project — an open-ended opportunity to collaborate across disciplines and make something new together.

Artist Wilbert Vogel will be taking over our BlaBlaLab makerspace, leading each meet-up. They will take care of supporting participants in their work, offering technical guidance, creative input, and live feedback throughout the sessions. With their deep experience in live coding, glitch aesthetics, and collaborative performance, Wilbert will also facilitate group discussions, moderate the “Share Your Screen” sessions, and contribute to shaping the evolving identity of the community project. Their role is not only that of a mentor but also of a co-creator—someone who sparks curiosity, nurtures experimentation, and helps turn ideas into working code and performative acts.

Program

🕕 6:00 PM – Walk-in, set up your gear, grab a drink and something to eat.

🕖 7:00 PM – Share Your Screen! An informal and welcoming moment where participants show their creative work live, directly from their screens. Whether you're presenting a finished project, an experiment, or something still messy and in-progress, the focus is on sharing ideas, challenges, and learning together — not on being perfect. It’s a space for open dialogue, feedback, and inspiration. Everyone is encouraged to participate, but there’s no pressure: you can also join just to listen, watch, and get inspired! 

🕖 8:00 PM - Brainstorm Community-driven project 

🕣 8:30 PM – Jam Session: open improvisation with live music and visuals. Bring your laptop, instruments, or just your curiosity!
