## About

Netherlands Coding Live (NL_CL) presents: ALGORAVE @ Vondelbunker

Come dance to handcrafted algorithms!

NL_CL is organising an Algorave together with the [Vondelbunker in Amsterdam](https://radar.squat.net/nl/amsterdam/vondelbunker)! An evening full of live coded electronic music and visuals by artists from our community. There will also be a performance by [Nabír](https://www.instagram.com/nabir___/), a guest live coder from Rome, Italy.

Algo-what??? An Algorave (@algorave) is an event where artists create electronic music and visuals "on-the-fly" (in realtime) by programming computer-code and algorithms. This is called "live coding" and is often improvised. It is a way to strip down technology, give openness and show what's happening behind our screens. The music throughout the evening has inspiration from many genres (from experimental, musique concrète, abstract, ambient to techno, house, dnb, acid and more). At moments it can be dance-able, and other moments you can dance a-rhythmically!

Line-up: Numberloup, Anabelmiryana, Richard van 't Hof, Eerie_ear, Lil Bleep, Nikilia, Nabír, Sabrina Verhage, tmhglnd, Saskia Freeke, Den Ree
