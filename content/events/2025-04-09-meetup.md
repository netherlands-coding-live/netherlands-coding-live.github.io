## About
This event is an open meetup of Rotterdam’s live coding community. Participating artists will show their work environments and creative ideas. The event is an informal yet informative open session anyone from the public is very welcome to participate, you do not need to have previous experience in live coding or software development. The idea is to share, learn and get inspired in dialogue.

The collective is a dynamic group that welcomes anyone with curiosity and a will to participate. This session will be hosted by Rotterdam artists Noemi Biro, Niki Scheijen (Nikilia), Rik Mertens (trem_werk), Bas Ekkelenkamp (333ak), Seb Pappalardo (eerie_ear). We will be showing our live coded works on a big screen, open a dialogue and we hope to see your works as well. As is common in live coding meetups, we like to have a “from-scratch” jam session at the end.
