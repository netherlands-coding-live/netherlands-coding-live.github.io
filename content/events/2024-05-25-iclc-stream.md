## About

TOPLAP will host streaming live coding in May as an ICLC 2024 Satellite Event. In sync with a regional theme of this year’s conference, TOPLAP will highlight live coding in Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and surrounding areas. The signup period will open first to that region, then will open to everyone globally for any remaining open slots.
