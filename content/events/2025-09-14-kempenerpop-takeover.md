## About
NL_CL is taking over a big stage on Sunday evening at the legendary local festival Kempenerpop. It's a 3 day free festival, and our community got a beautiful offer to show off live_coding in its different shapes and forms. 

So far we have N1k1l1a showing off her skills on the tent's unique setup. Expect multiple screens and visuals all over the place🌈.
Next up we have tmhglnd, a live_coding veteran well known for his creation of his own musical live_coding language, Mercury 🧑‍💻.
Flying in from Barcelona, Spain, we have Linalab, co-founder of TopLap Barcelona and part of axolot.cat, a real digital 🧙‍♂️ behind the keyboard.
Last but not least, we have Lil-Bleep spicing it up with Orca 🐋. They will make a special breakbeat set for this festival.

one more artist TBA

We hope to see you all coming by on this FREE festival.
