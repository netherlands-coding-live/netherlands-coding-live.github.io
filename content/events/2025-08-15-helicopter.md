# LAST MINUTE ORGANIZED CODING JAM!

Join us for an evening of live coded music made by artists from the Netherlands Coding Live community (NL_CL). We will also have a guest from Barcelona, Maia Francisco (https://maiafrancisco.com/) who helped setting up this evening in Helicopter together with Lam Lai. Expect an evening full of algorithmic thinking, live programming, showing screens, fixing errors and adventurous music and visuals.

We'll have an open stage for a 9-min from-scratch live coding session. If you like to participate in the session, please feel free to send us a message! Or come to the event with your laptop and let us know before we start.

**The "from-scratch" rules:**

- Live code for **9 minutes** *(no more, no less, we set a timer)*
- Use any programming language you prefer
- Start with an empty code editor
- Program music or visuals *(or something else if you have crazy ideas!)*
- The audience always claps at the end!
- The line-up is decided (psuedo-)randomly at the beginning of the event
